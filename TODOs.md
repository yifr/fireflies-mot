MCMC Rejuvenation -- mh proposal - delete some choices, re-run and potentially update if you satisfy this ratio:

P(x')  g(x | x')
----- -----------
P(x)   g(x'| x)

Proposal (forward kernel) -- generative function that outputs a choicemap whose choices are a subset of O_t

i'd really like to improve the generative model

Unfold to-dos:
write observation model (either rendered or symbolic) for unfold model
- benefit of non-pixel based: quicker to write, faster to run, conceptually simpler?
- benefit of pixel based: realism?? more computer-vision-y? 

write simple particle filter
animation showing population estimates of number over time

Observation model:
- given trace, at each time step get true blink locations and add some noise to them (location, occasional misses)


what happens when you think of too large a plan
- stress --> "I can't do that", desire for immediate gratification, distraction
- when breaking problem down, try and estimate value / reward
- what motivates me? Imagine how nice it would be to show up to the next gen-brain meeting with a working model. No longer feel like a lab misfit.

- what's the difference between sticking this out and trying to do something vs. getting up and watching a movie?
- with coding, there's a perpetual feeling of stress and fear of failure
- with a movie, there's little effort involved, lots of stimulation, and the cost:benefit ratio of enjoyment is high.
- So to do a task I need to or want to do, I need to either amp up the perceived benefit, or decrease the cost. 
- I wonder how people weight costs vs benefits
